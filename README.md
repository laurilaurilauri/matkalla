# Audio feature
Each story page includes a **Play music** button that toggles looped playback of an mp3 audiofile. The behavior is managed by `audio.js` and requires only modern browsers with HTML5 audio support.

# Animation
<<<<<<< HEAD
Playing music toggles an animation that resembles rain falling on the art piece. Intent to tweak this animation further in the future, maybe adding interactive possibilites for the viewer.
