## Audio feature

Place an MP3 file at `audio/music.mp3` in the root of the project (create the `audio` folder if it does not already exist). Each story page includes a **Play music** button that toggles looped playback of this file. The behavior is managed by `audio.js` and requires only modern browsers with HTML5 audio support.
